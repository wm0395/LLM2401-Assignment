acrodermatitis enteropathica is not a inborn metal metabolism disorder,False,"  Based on the provided context, the answer is:

{
""answer"": ""False""
}

Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a genetic disease that affects the skin, nervous system, mouth, and gastrointestinal tract. It is caused by a defect in the gene that codes for the enzyme zinc ultramicroembryonic protein (ZUMP), which is essential for the absorption and transport of zinc in the body. Zinc deficiency is a hallmark of this condition, and it can lead to a range of symptoms, including inflammatory abnormalities of the skin, nervous system, mouth, and gastrointestinal tract.

Therefore, acrodermatitis enteropathica is not a inborn metal metabolism disorder, but rather a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to absorb and utilize zinc."
